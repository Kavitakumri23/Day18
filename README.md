📅 Day 18 – Cyclic Sort
Today I learned and implemented the Cyclic Sort Algorithm in Java.

🔍 What is Cyclic Sort?
Cyclic Sort is a very efficient in-place sorting algorithm used when:
The array contains numbers in the range 1 to N (or 0 to N).
Each number is unique.
We want to place each number directly at its correct index.

👉 It sorts the array in O(n) time without using extra space.
